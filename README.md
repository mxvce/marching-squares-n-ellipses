Just learning marching squares and sdl3 and quicky put together some code.

Program draws an `n-ellipse`.

In order to run the code:
- download files and follow steps from [Link to demo project in sdl](https://github.com/Ravbug/sdl3-sample/wiki/Setting-up-your-computer)
- replace `src/main.cpp` with code from repo
- run the project using `running.sh` script
- start the program by running `./build/sdl-min`

I was also thinking about adding:
- creating new focus points
- moving focus points around with a mouse
- making better fps counter
